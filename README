NAME
    an - AutoNamer, Simple app that tries to correctly name media files.

SYNOPSIS
            an [options] [files...]

OPTIONS
    --dir [path]
    -d [path]
            By default AN will try to rename the file in place, not altering
            the original files path. If you wish to output the media file to
            an alternate directory you can specify the output path here.

    --dryrun
    -n      Do everything BUT change the filename. This is used mainly to
            see what AN *would* do without actually doing it.

    --garbage
    --no-garbage
            Try to clean up the filename by removing all non english
            standard characters from the file name. Can be negated with
            --no-year.

    --imdb
    --no-imdb
            Try to contact IMDB to finalize details we've guessed in the
            earlier stages. Can be negated with --no-imdb.

    --interactive
    -i      Specifies that AN should operate in interactive mode. After
            determining the desination file the user will be presented with
            options as to what operations to apply.

    --regexp
    --no-regexp
            Apply the known regular expression hacks to try to tidy up the
            title. Can be negated with --no-regexp.

    --skipaf
            Skip the IMDB stage if we dont manage to clean up the file name
            correctly. If not set (the default) and the autocorrection stage
            fails, the original filename will be passed onto IMDB in a last
            ditch attempt to get something meaningful.

    -v
    --verbose
            Be more verbose when outputting information to STDERR. Specify
            multiple times to increase verbosity.

    -t [string]
    --template [string]
            Overide the default output filename template. By default the
            template is '%t.%e'.

            The following strings will be expanded when determining the
            output filename:

            %e  The original file extension.

            %t  The title of the media, determined after the auto correction
                and (optional) IMDB stages.

            %y  The year the media was made.

    --year
    --no-year
            Extract the year of the media from the title and use it in the
            subsequent IMDB query (unless --no-imdb is set) Can be negated
            with --no-year.

DESCRIPTION
    AN is a simple file renamer that trys to apply a variety of methods to
    determine the true name of a given set of files. It can optionally
    rename the source files (and even move them) to the output filenames.

EXAMPLES
    an movies/*
        Simplist use of AN. This will scan the contents of the 'movies'
        directory for files matching recognized extensions. If it matches it
        will inteligently rename them.

    an -n movies/*
        Same as above but doesn't actually do anything. This is useful to
        see the effect of the renaming process without actually applying the
        effects.

    an movies/* -d .
        Scan the 'movies' directory renaming files as we go. Renamed files
        will be moved into the current directory.

    an movies/* -d -t '%t (%y).%e
        Same as above but also renames the files using the format 'Title
        (year).extension' e.g. 'Troy (2004).avi'.

INSTALLATION
    AN requires a certain set of CPAN modules. These can be installed using
    the following command as root:

            cpan IMDB::Film

    The module IMDB::Film has a nasty habit of failing tests. If prompted to
    perform these during the CPAN installation its probably best to select
    the default 'no' option when asked if you wish to test the module.

BUGS
    Quite probably.

    Please report to the author when found.
